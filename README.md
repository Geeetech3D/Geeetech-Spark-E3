# Geeetech-Spark-E3
Spark E3 V1.0 is a universal FDM 3D printer motherboard developed by GEEETECH. It inherits the excellent design of GEEETECH GT2560 classic motherboard and uses STM32F103VET6 MCU, which has a lot of resources in the open source community. At the same time, the hot bed and hot end use high-power quality MOS tubes, which are durable. The Micro SD slot is equipped with a dedicated electrostatic protection device. The 24V, 5V, and 3.3V power supplies all use large-capacity filter capacitors, which can provide better stability and user experience for 3D printers. It can be used to upgrade the original motherboard of Ender3/Ender Pro/Ender3 V2/Ender5/Ender6 and other models.
  
Geeetech Spark E3 Features are as follows:

1. Master control chip, the ARM Cortex M3 32 - bit STM32F103RCT6, frequency of 72 MHZ.

2. Support four stepper motor driver using pluggable module design, and compared the onboard motor driver, users will be able to replace driver.

3. Support A4988, TMC2208 and TMC2209 three common driver module.

4. support TMC2209 Sensorless function.

5. limit switch interface compatible with 3 line photoelectric limit switch.

6. support 8080 interface touch screen.

7. 4-way fan interface, of which 3 road PWM control, normally open all the way fan interface.

8. motherboard support 3 d - Touch, Neopixel lamp tape, printed after the shutdown module, detection module, the power of break to continue playing module function extension module.

7. bed and hot end using large current MOS tube, more durable, not easy to damage.

GEEETECH Spark E3 V1.3 can replace the original motherboards of Ender 3, Ender 3 Pro, and Ender 5 models, and also use the original 12864 LCD display of these three models. Because of the communication protocol, if you want to use the color touch screen, you need to match the color touch screen provided by GEEETECH.

GEEETECH Spark E3 V1.3 supports Marlin firmware. We have compiled firmware with different hardware configurations for Ender3 in advance. You can download and use the firmware according to your actual 3D printer.


Disclaimer:

Marlin firmware needs customized configuration by users. GEEETECH only provides motherboards that are responsible for Marlin firmware specifications. At the same time, GEEETTECH does not know the hardware configuration of each customer's 3D printer, because we cannot customize exclusive Marlin firmware for each customer. GEEETECH can provide the necessary technical support for each customer. You can contact us through the following three channels:
