GEEETECH Spark E3 V1.3 supports Marlin firmware. We have compiled firmware with different hardware configurations for Ender3 in advance. You can download and use the firmware according to your actual 3D printer.


Disclaimer:

Marlin firmware needs customized configuration by users. GEEETECH only provides motherboards that are responsible for Marlin firmware specifications. At the same time, GEEETTECH does not know the hardware configuration of each customer's 3D printer, because we cannot customize exclusive Marlin firmware for each customer. GEEETECH can provide the necessary technical support for each customer. You can contact us through the following three channels:
